# Roborock advance

This unofficial integration of the [Local Home SDK](https://developers.google.com/actions/smarthome/concepts/local) to control Roborock Vacuum cleaner and Aquara AC partner v1. 

Current version supports :

### Vacuum:
+ device start/stop/pause
+ device docking
+ device location
+ zone(room) cleaning 
+ each zone has default mode 
    - eg. set higher suction power, when cleaning kitchen 
+ predefined device modes 
   1. mopping
   2. low
   3. balanced
   4. high
   5. turbo
+ predefined target points, go to position

### Air Conditioner:
+ modes
    - cooling
    - heating
    - auto(eco)
    - dry
    - fan
    - off
+ fan speed
    - low
    - medium
    - high
    - auto
+ set temperature in range of 17*..30* C

Local Home SDK requires ambient temperature to be reported to be able to set temperature,

The Local Home SDK allows to execute smart home intents directly on Google Home smart speakers and Nest smart displays. 

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS 10.16.0+

## Run the sample

### Set up the smart home project

- Follow the instruction to deploy the [smart home provider sample for Node.js](https://github.com/actions-on-google/smart-home-nodejs).
- Follow the instructions to run the [smart home frontend](https://github.com/actions-on-google/smart-home-nodejs#setup-sample-service) locally.
- Upload backup from [Flole app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.flole.xiaomi&hl=en) on login

### Setup the virtual device

- Open the smart home project in the [Actions console](https://console.actions.google.com/), then perform these steps:
   - in `Build > Actions > Smart home > Actions`: Add the following attributes in the `Device Scan Configuration`:
     - **MDNS Service name**: `_miio._udp.local`

### Deploy the sample app

Serve the sample app locally from the same local network as the Home device,
or deploy it to a publicly reacheable URL endpoint.

#### Deploy locally

- Start the local development server:
```
npm install --prefix app/
npm start --prefix app/ -- --public 0.0.0.0:8080
```
Note: The local development server needs to listen on the same local network as the Home device in order to be able to load the Local Home SDK application.
- Go to the [smart home project in the Actions console](https://console.actions.google.com/)
- In `Test > On device testing`: set the development URL to http://local-dev-server-hostname-or-ip:8080/


### Test the Local Home SDK application

- Reboot the Google Home Device
- Open `chrome://inspect`
- Locate the Local Home SDK application and click `inspect` to launch the [Chrome developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
- Try the following query
  - `Where is my roborock`
  - `Start cleaning`
  - `Clean my living room`
  - `Set roborock mode to balanced`
  - `Set roborock mode to mop the floor`

## Test and Lint
```
npm test --prefix app/
npm run lint --prefix device/
```
